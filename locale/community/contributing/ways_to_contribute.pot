msgid "GaaeExplorer Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project. Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) developers are working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal interest and for the love of creating a libre engine of exceptional quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../community/contributing/ways_to_contribute.rst:11
msgid "This means that to thrive, GaaeExplorer needs as many users as possible to get involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute to such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring something positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"
msgstr ""

#: ../community/contributing/ways_to_contribute.rst:16
msgid "**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to GaaeExplorer and help it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, forums, Contributors Chat, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget and can therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."

msgid "**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially the industry at large that GaaeExplorer is a relevant market player, we need great games made with GaaeExplorer. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still lack big releases that will draw attention to GaaeExplorer. So keep working on your awesome projects, each new game increases our credibility on the gamedev market!"
msgstr ""

#: ../community/contributing/ways_to_contribute.rst:32
msgid "**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly the git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue tracker, improve the official documentation (both the class reference and tutorials) and its translations. The following sections will cover each of those \"direct\" ways of contributing to the engine."

msgid "**Donate.** GaaeExplorer is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting costs or promotional material on events, we also use donation money to acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a MacBook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire core developers so they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to continue doing this, which has been very beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate some money to the project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/donate>`_ for details."

msgstr ""

#: ../community/contributing/ways_to_contribute.rst:70
msgid "Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your own project, if they are too specific."

msgid "All pull requests must go through a review process before being accepted. Depending on the scope of the changes, it may take some time for a maintainer responsible for the modified part of the engine to provide their review. We value all of our contributors and ask them to be patient in the meantime, as it is expected that in an open source project like GaaeExplorer, there is going to be way more contributions than people validating them."

msgid "To make sure that your time and efforts aren't wasted, it is recommended to vet the idea first before implementing it and putting it for a review as a PR. To that end, GaaeExplorer has a `proposal system <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals>`_. Its usage is encouraged to plan changes and discuss them with the community. Implementation details can also be discussed with other contributors on the `GaaeExplorer Contributors Chat <https://chat.godotengine.org/>`_."

You noticed *symptoms* that make you think that something might be wrong (the engine crashes, some features don't work as expected, etc.). It's the role of the bug triaging team and the developers to then help make the diagnosis of the issue you met, so that the actual cause of the bug can be identified and addressed."

msgid "**GaaeExplorer version.** This is a must-have. Some issues might be relevant in the current stable release, but fixed in the development branch, or the other way around. You might also be using an obsolete version of GaaeExplorer and experiencing a known issue fixed in a later version, so knowing this from the start helps to speed up the diagnosis."
msgstr ""

#: ../community/contributing/ways_to_contribute.rst:177
msgid "**How to reproduce the bug.** In the majority of cases, bugs are reproducible, i.e. it is possible to trigger them reliably by following some steps. Please always describe those steps as clearly as possible, so that everyone can try to reproduce the issue and confirm it. Ideally, make a demo project that reproduces this issue out of the box, zip it and attach it to the issue (you can do this by drag and drop). Even if you think that the issue is trivial to reproduce, adding a minimal project that lets everyone reproduce it is a big added value. You have to keep in mind that there are thousands of issues in the tracker, and developers can only dedicate little time to each issue."
