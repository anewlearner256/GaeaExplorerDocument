msgid "Using signals"
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:14
msgid "In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit when something specific happens to them, like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:18
msgid "Signals are a delegation mechanism built into GaaeExplorer that allows one game object to react to a change in another without them referencing one another. Using signals limits `coupling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)>`_ and keeps your code flexible."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:24
msgid "For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the player’s health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in GaaeExplorer, you would use signals."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:28
msgid "As mentioned in the introduction, signals are GaaeExplorer's version of the observer pattern. You can learn more about it here: https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html"

msgid "Connecting a signal in the editor"
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:94
msgid "Here, we want to connect the Button's \"pressed\" signal to our Sprite, and we want to call a new function that will toggle its motion on and off. We need to have a script attached to the Sprite node, which we do from the previous lesson."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:98
msgid "You can connect signals in the Node dock. Select the Button node and, on the right side of the editor, click on the tab named \"Node\" next to the Inspector."

msgid "Double-click the \"pressed\" signal to open the node connection window."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:111
msgid "There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite node. The node needs a receiver method, a function that GaaeExplorer will call when the Button emits the signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we name these callback methods \"_on_NodeName_signal_name\". Here, it'll be \"_on_Button_pressed\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:118
msgid "When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two modes. The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have a script attached to them and creates a new callback function on them."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:124
msgid "The advanced view lets you connect to any node and any built-in function, add arguments to the callback, and set options. You can toggle the mode in the window's bottom-right by clicking the Advanced button."

msgid "Let's replace the line with the ``pass`` keyword with code that'll toggle the node's motion."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:143
msgid "Our Sprite moves thanks to code in the ``_process()`` function. GaaeExplorer provides a method to toggle processing on and off: :ref:`Node.set_process() <class_Node_method_set_process>`. Another method of the Node class, ``is_processing()``, returns ``true`` if idle processing is active. We can use the ``not`` keyword to invert the value."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:155
msgid "This function will toggle processing and, in turn, the icon's motion on and off upon pressing the button."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:158
msgid "Before trying the game, we need to simplify our ``_process()`` function to move the node automatically and not wait for user input. Replace it with the following code, which we saw two lessons ago:"
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:170
msgid "Your complete ``Sprite.gd`` code should look like the following."

msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:195

msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:198
msgid "Let's use a different node here. GaaeExplorer has a :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` node that's useful to implement skill cooldown times, weapon reloading, and more."

msgid "Call the Timer's ``connect()`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:224
msgid "To connect to a signal via code, you need to call the ``connect()`` method of the node you want to listen to. In this case, we want to listen to the Timer's \"timeout\" signal."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:228
msgid "We want to connect the signal when the scene is instantiated, and we can do that using the :ref:`Node._ready() <class_Node_method__ready>` built-in function, which is called automatically by the engine when a node is fully instantiated."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:232
msgid "To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the method :ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>`. We can store the reference in a variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:242
msgid "The function ``get_node()`` looks at the Sprite's children and gets nodes by their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to \"BlinkingTimer\" in the editor, you would have to change the call to ``get_node(\"BlinkingTimer\")``."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:248
msgid "We can now connect the Timer to the Sprite in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:257
msgid "The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's \"timeout\" signal to the node to which the script is attached (``self``). When the Timer emits \"timeout\", we want to call the function \"_on_Timer_timeout\", that we need to define. Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to toggle our sprite's visibility."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:268
msgid "The ``visible`` property is a boolean that controls the visibility of our node. The line ``visible = not visible`` toggles the value. If ``visible`` is ``true``, it becomes ``false``, and vice-versa."

msgid "This section is a reference on how to define and use your own signals, and does not build upon the project created in previous lessons."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:314
msgid "You can define custom signals in a script. Say, for example, that you want to show a game over screen when the player's health reaches zero. To do so, you could define a signal named \"died\" or \"health_depleted\" when their health reaches 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:328
msgid "As signals represent events that just occurred, we generally use an action verb in the past tense in their names."

msgid "To emit a signal in your scripts, call ``emit_signal()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A signal can optionally declare one or more arguments. Specify the argument names between parentheses:"
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:358
msgid "The signal arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and GaaeExplorer can use them to generate callback functions for you. However, you can still emit any number of arguments when you emit signals. So it's up to you to emit the correct values."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:363

msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:381
msgid "Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or leaving an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and much more."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:385
msgid "For example, an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` representing a coin emits a ``body_entered`` signal whenever the player's physics body enters its collision shape, allowing you to know when the player collected it."
