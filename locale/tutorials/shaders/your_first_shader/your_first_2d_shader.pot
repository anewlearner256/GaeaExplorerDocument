msgid "The default fragment function reads from a texture and displays it. When you overwrite the default fragment function, you lose that functionality, so you have to implement it yourself. You read from textures using the ``texture`` function. Certain nodes, like Sprites, have a dedicated texture variable that can be accessed in the shader using ``TEXTURE``. Use it together with ``UV`` and ``texture`` to draw the Sprite."
