msgid "Importing assets in GaaeExplorer 3.0+"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:9
msgid "Previously, importing assets in GaaeExplorer 2.x required manual maintenance of a separate directory with source assets. Without doing this, it was impossible to specify how to convert and change import flags for textures, audio files, scenes, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:14
msgid "In GaaeExplorer 3.0+, we use a more modern approach to importing: Simply drop your assets (image files, scenes, audio files, fonts, etc) directly in the project folder (copy them manually with your OS file explorer). GaaeExplorer will automatically import these files internally and keep the imported resources hidden in a ``res://.import`` folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:20
msgid "This means that when trying to access imported assets through code you need to use the :ref:`Resource Loader<class_ResourceLoader>` as it will automatically take into account where the internal files are saved. If you try and access an imported asset using the :ref:`File <class_File>` class it will work in the editor, but break in the exported project."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:26
msgid "However, the :ref:`Resource Loader<class_ResourceLoader>` cannot access non imported files, only the :ref:`File <class_File>` class can."

msgid "To change the import parameters of an asset in GaaeExplorer (again, keep in mind import parameters are only present in non-native GaaeExplorer resource types) select the relevant resource in the filesystem dock:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:38
msgid "Then, after adjusting the parameters, press \"Reimport\". These parameters will only be used for this asset and on future reimports."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:41
msgid "Changing the import parameters of several assets at the same time is also possible. Simply select all of them together in the resources dock and the exposed parameters will apply to all of them when reimporting."

msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:48
msgid "While working on a project you may find that several assets need to have the same parameters changed, such as enabling mipmaps, but you only want those specific parameters changed. To do this, select every asset you want to reimport in the file system. In the import tab there will now be a checkbox to the left of every import parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:56
msgid "Select the checkbox of the parameters you want to change on your imported assets, then change the parameters normally. Finally, click the reimport button and every selected asset will be reimported with only those parameters changed."

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:80
msgid "If any of the files present in this folder is erased (or the whole folder), the asset or assets will be reimported automatically. As such, committing this folder to the version control system is optional. It can shorten reimporting time when checking out on another computer, but it takes considerably more space and transfer time. Pick your poison!"
