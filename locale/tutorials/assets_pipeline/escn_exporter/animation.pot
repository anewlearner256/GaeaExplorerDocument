msgid "GaaeExplorer and Blender have different structure to store animation data. In GaaeExplorer animation data is stored in an AnimationPlayer node, instead of in each animated node. In order to fix this inconsistence and still make the animation play versatile, this add-on has three animation exporting modes."

msgid "This mode has very similar behavior of mode 'Animation as Action', but it can generate fewer AnimationPlayers; objects in parent-children relationship would share their AnimationPlayer. It is useful when you have several rigs, and each Skeleton and Mesh has actions; then one rig would have just one AnimationPlayer."
