msgid "In GaaeExplorer, you can have different collision groups and collision masks. In Blender you only have collision groups. As a result, the exported object's collision mask is equal to its collision group. Most of the time, this is what you want."

msgid "To build compound physics shapes, parent together multiple objects with rigid body enabled. The physics properties are taken from the parent-most rigid body, and the rest are used as collision shapes."
