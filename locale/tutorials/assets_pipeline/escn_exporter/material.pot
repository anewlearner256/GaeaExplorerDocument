msgid "One way in which the exporter can handle materials is to attempt to match the Blender material with an existing GaaeExplorer material. This has the advantage of being able to use all of the features of GaaeExplorer's material system, but it means that you cannot see your model with the material applied inside Blender."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/assets_pipeline/escn_exporter/material.rst:12
msgid "To do this, the exporter attempts to find GaaeExplorer materials with names that match those of the material name in Blender. So if you export an object in Blender with the material name ``PurpleDots`` then the exporter will search for the file ``PurpleDots.tres`` and assign it to the object. If this file is not a ``SpatialMaterial`` or ``ShaderMaterial`` or if it cannot be found, then the exporter will fall back to exporting the material from Blender."
