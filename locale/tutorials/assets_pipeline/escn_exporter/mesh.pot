msgid "A lot of modifiers are not compatible with shape keys (e.g. subsurface modifier), so if you found you have incorrect shape keys exported, try to disable :code:`Apply Modifiers` and do the exporting again. Besides, it is worthwhile to report the incompatible modifier to the `issue list <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter/issues>`__, which helps to develop the exporter to have a more precise check of modifiers."
