msgid "This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and their uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and GaaeExplorer uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math is essential to becoming a strong game developer."

msgstr ""

msgid "Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this way. However, we can also think of the position ``(4, 3)`` as an **offset** from the ``(0, 0)`` point, or **origin**. Draw an arrow pointing from the origin to the point:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/math/vector_math.rst:41
msgid "This is a **vector**. A vector represents a lot of useful information. As well as telling us that the point is at ``(4, 3)``, we can also think of it as an angle ``θ`` and a length (or magnitude) ``m``. In this case, the arrow is a **position vector** - it denotes a position in space, relative to the origin."

#: ../tutorials/math/vector_math.rst:280
msgid "The dot product is most useful when used with unit vectors, making the first formula reduce to just ``cosθ``. This means we can use the dot product to tell us something about the angle between two vectors:"

msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/math/vector_math.rst:298
msgid "The green arrows ``fA`` and ``fB`` are **unit vectors** representing the zombies' facing directions and the blue semicircle represents its field of view. For zombie ``A``, we find the direction vector ``AP`` pointing to the player using ``P - A`` and normalize it, however, GaaeExplorer has a helper method to do this called ``direction_to``. If the angle between this vector and the facing vector is less than 90°, then the zombie can see the player."

#: ../tutorials/math/vector_math.rst:326
msgid "Like the dot product, the **cross product** is an operation on two vectors. However, the result of the cross product is a vector with a direction that is perpendicular to both. Its magnitude depends on their relative angle. If two vectors are parallel, the result of their cross product will be a null vector."

msgid "Calculating normals"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/math/vector_math.rst:372
msgid "One common use of cross products is to find the surface normal of a plane or surface in 3D space. If we have the triangle ``ABC`` we can use vector subtraction to find two edges ``AB`` and ``AC``. Using the cross product, ``AB x AC`` produces a vector perpendicular to both: the surface normal."

msgid "In the dot product section above, we saw how it could be used to find the angle between two vectors. However, in 3D, this is not enough information. We also need to know what axis to rotate around. We can find that by calculating the cross product of the current facing direction and the target direction.
