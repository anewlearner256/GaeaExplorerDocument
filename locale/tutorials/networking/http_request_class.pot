msgid "The :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node is the easiest way to make HTTP requests in GaaeExplorer. It is backed by the more low-level :ref:`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>`, for which a tutorial is available :ref:`here <doc_http_client_class>`."

msgid "For the sake of this example, we will create a simple UI with a button, that when pressed will start the HTTP request to the specified URL."

msgid "When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android."

msgid "Create a new empty scene, add a CanvasLayer as the root node and add a script to it. Then add two child nodes to it: a Button and an HTTPRequest node. You will need to connect the following signals to the CanvasLayer script:"

msgid "Below is all the code we need to make it work. The URL points to an online API mocker; it returns a pre-defined JSON string, which we will then parse to get access to the data."

msgid "Of course, you can also set custom HTTP headers. These are given as a string array, with each string containing a header in the format ``\"header: value\"``. For example, to set a custom user agent (the HTTP ``user-agent`` header) you could use the following:"

msgid "Also, when calling APIs using authorization, be aware that someone might analyse and decompile your released application and thus may gain access to any embedded authorization information like tokens, usernames or passwords. That means it is usually not a good idea to embed things such as database access credentials inside your game. Avoid providing information useful to an attacker whenever possible."

#: ../tutorials/networking/http_request_class.rst:123
msgid "Keep in mind that you have to wait for a request to finish before sending another one. Making multiple request at once requires you to have one node per request. A common strategy is to create and delete HTTPRequest nodes at runtime as necessary."
