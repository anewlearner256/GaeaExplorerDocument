msgid "The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTPRequests, which is not well-suited for bidirectional communication."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/networking/websocket.rst:12
msgid "The protocol is quite simple, message based, and a very powerful tool to send push notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, turn-based games, etc. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like VoIP and fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use cases)."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/networking/websocket.rst:14
msgid "Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than a raw TCP connection, WebSocket soon started to spread outside the browsers, in native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."

msgid "WebSocket is implemented in GaaeExplorer via three main classes :ref:`WebSocketClient <class_WebSocketClient>`, :ref:`WebSocketServer <class_WebSocketServer>`, and :ref:`WebSocketPeer <class_WebSocketPeer>`. The WebSocket implementation is compatible with the High Level Multiplayer. See section on :ref:`high-level multiplayer <doc_high_level_multiplayer>` for more details."
