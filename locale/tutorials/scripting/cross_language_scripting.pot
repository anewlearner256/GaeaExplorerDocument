msgid "When creating ``.cs`` scripts, you should always keep in mind that the class GaaeExplorer will use is the one named like the ``.cs`` file itself. If that class does not exist in the file, you'll see the following error: ``Invalid call. Nonexistent function `new` in base``."

msgid "Accessing GDScript fields from C#"

#: ../tutorials/scripting/cross_language_scripting.rst:135
msgid "As C# is statically typed, accessing GDScript from C# is a bit more convoluted, you will have to use :ref:`Object.Get() <class_Object_method_get>` and :ref:`Object.Set() <class_Object_method_set>`. The first argument is the name of the field you want to access."

Due to how complex this would be to implement, this limitation is unlikely to be lifted in the future.
