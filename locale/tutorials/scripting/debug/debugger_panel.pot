msgid "Unlike other debugging tools, the profiler does not start automatically. It can be started at any time during gameplay by pressing the start button. You can even start the profiler before opening the game to profile startup performance. It can also be started and stopped while the game is running without losing information from when it was last running. The information it records won't go away unless you click clear, or close the game, reopen it and start the profiler again."

All monitors keep track of stats automatically, so even if one monitor isn't open while the game is running, you can open it later and see how the values changed."
