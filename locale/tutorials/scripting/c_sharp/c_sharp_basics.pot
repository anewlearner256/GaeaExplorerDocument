Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. A good starting point for checking its capabilities is the `Compatibility <http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/compatibility/>`_ page in the Mono documentation."
