msgid "One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), it's good to let the user know that it exists."

msgid "After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, GaaeExplorer can detect when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."

#: ../tutorials/export/one-click_deploy.rst:22
msgid "One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template marked as **Runnable** in the Export dialog. You can mark several export presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."
