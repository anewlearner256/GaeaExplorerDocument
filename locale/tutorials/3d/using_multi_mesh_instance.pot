msgid "In a normal scenario, you would use a :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` node to display a 3D mesh like a human model for the main character, but in some cases, you would like to create multiple instances of the same mesh in a scene. You *could* duplicate the same node multiple times and adjust the transforms manually. This may be a tedious process and the result may look mechanical. Also, this method is not conducive to rapid iterations. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance <class_MultiMeshInstance>` is one of the possible solutions to this problem."
