msgid "The preferred way to find GaaeExplorer plugins is to use the `Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/>`_. While it can be browsed online, it's more convenient to use it directly from the editor. To do so, click the **AssetLib** tab at the top of the editor:"

msgid "Some repositories describe themselves as \"plugins\" but may not actually be *editor* plugins. This is especially the case for scripts that are intended to be used in a running project. You don't need to enable such plugins to use them. Download them and extract the files in your project folder."

msgid "One way to distinguish editor plugins from non-editor plugins is to look for a ``plugin.cfg`` file in the repository that hosts the plugin. If the repository contains a ``plugin.cfg`` file in a folder placed in the ``addons/`` folder, then it is an editor plugin."

msgid "On GitHub, if a plugin has *tags* (versions) declared, go to the **Releases** tab to download a stable release. This ensures you download a version that was declared to be stable by its author."

msgid "Extract the ZIP archive and move the ``addons/`` folder it contains into your project folder. If your project already contains an ``addons/`` folder, move the plugin's ``addons/`` folder into your project folder to merge the new folder contents with the existing one. Your file manager may ask you whether to write into the folder; answer **Yes**. No files will be overwritten in the process."

If the plugin was packaged correctly, you should see it in the list of plugins. Click on the gray **Inactive** text and choose **Active** to enable the plugin. The word **Active** will display in green to confirm the plugin was enabled."
