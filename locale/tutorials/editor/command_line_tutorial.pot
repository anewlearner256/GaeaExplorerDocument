msgid "Some developers like using the command line extensively. GaaeExplorer is designed to be friendly to them, so here are the steps for working entirely from the command line. Given the engine relies on almost no external libraries, initialization times are pretty fast, making it suitable for this workflow."

To run a GaaeExplorer binary from a terminal on macOS, you have to ``cd`` to the folder where the GaaeExplorer application bundle is located, then run ``GaaeExplorer.app/Contents/MacOS/GaaeExplorer`` followed by any command line arguments. If you've renamed the application bundle from ``GaaeExplorer`` to another name, make sure to edit this command line accordingly."
