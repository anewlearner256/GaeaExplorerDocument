msgid "In certain situations, it may be desirable to limit what features can be used in the GaaeExplorer editor. For example, a UI designer on a team who doesn't need to see 3D features, or an educator slowly introducing features to students. GaaeExplorer has a built in system called \"feature profiles\" to do this."

#: ../tutorials/editor/managing_editor_features.rst:14
msgid "With feature profiles, major features and nodes can be hidden from the editor. This only hides parts of the interface and does not actually remove support for these features, so scenes and scripts relying on those features will still work fine. This also means feature profiles are not an optimization technique. For information on how to optimize GaaeExplorer see :ref:`doc_optimization`."

Below the main features is every class and node in GaaeExplorer, which can be disabled as well. Click on a node and all of its properties and options will be listed in the **Extra Items** box, these can all be individually disabled."

msgid "This process is potentially cumbersome however if a large amount of computers need custom profiles. As an alternative, you can enable self-contained mode for GaaeExplorer, which allows putting all editor configuration in the same folder as the editor binary. See :ref:`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode` for details."
