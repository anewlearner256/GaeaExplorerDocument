msgid "In addition to :ref:`doc_importing_translations` in CSV format, GaaeExplorer also supports loading translation files written in the GNU gettext format (text-based ``.po`` and compiled ``.mo`` since GaaeExplorer 3.5)."

msgid "For an introduction to gettext, check out `A Quick Gettext Tutorial <https://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/posts/programming/a-quick-gettext-tutorial.html>`_. It's written with C projects in mind, but much of the advice also applies to GaaeExplorer (with the exception of ``xgettext``)."

#: ../tutorials/i18n/localization_using_gettext.rst:20
msgid "gettext is supported by translation platforms such as `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_ and `Weblate <https://weblate.org/>`_, which makes it easier for people to collaborate to localization."

#: ../tutorials/i18n/localization_using_gettext.rst:23
msgid "Compared to CSV, gettext works better with version control systems like Git, as each locale has its own messages file."

msgid "gettext is a more complex format than CSV and can be harder to grasp for people new to software localization."

msgid "People who maintain localization files will have to install gettext tools on their system. However, as GaaeExplorer supports using text-based message files (``.po``), translators can test their work without having to install gettext tools."

msgid "Caveats"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/i18n/localization_using_gettext.rst:40
msgid "As GaaeExplorer uses its own PO file parser behind the scenes (which is more limited than the reference GNU gettext implementation), some features such as pluralization aren't supported."
