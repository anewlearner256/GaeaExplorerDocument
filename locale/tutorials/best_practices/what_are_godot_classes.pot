msgid "The engine offers two main ways to create reusable objects: scripts and scenes. Neither of these technically define classes under the hood."

msgid "Still, many best practices using GaaeExplorer involve applying object-oriented programming principles to the scripts and scenes that compose your game. That is why it's useful to understand how we can think of them as classes."

msgid "The engine provides built-in classes like :ref:`Node <class_Node>`. You can extend those to create derived types using a script."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:22
msgid "These scripts are not technically classes. Instead, they are resources that tell the engine a sequence of initializations to perform on one of the engine's built-in classes."

msgid "GaaeExplorer's internal classes have methods that register a class's data with a :ref:`ClassDB <class_ClassDB>`. This database provides runtime access to class information. ``ClassDB`` contains information about classes like:"

msgid "This ``ClassDB`` is what objects check against when performing an operation like accessing a property or calling a method. It checks the database's records and the object's base types' records to see if the object supports the operation."

#: ../tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:43
msgid "Even scripts that don't use the ``extends`` keyword implicitly inherit from the engine's base :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>` class. As a result, you can instantiate scripts without the ``extends`` keyword from code. Since they extend ``Reference`` though, you cannot attach them to a :ref:`Node <class_Node>`."

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:51
msgid "The behavior of scenes has many similarities to classes, so it can make sense to think of a scene as a class. Scenes are reusable, instantiable, and inheritable groups of nodes. Creating a scene is similar to having a script that creates nodes and adds them as children using ``add_child()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:55
msgid "We often pair a scene with a scripted root node that makes use of the scene's nodes. As such, the scene is often an extension of the script's declarative code."

msgid "Why is any of this important to scene organization? Because instances of scenes *are* objects. As a result, many object-oriented principles that apply to written code also apply to scenes: single responsibility, encapsulation, and others."
