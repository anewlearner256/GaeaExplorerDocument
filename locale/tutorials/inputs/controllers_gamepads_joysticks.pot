msgid "Unlike keyboards and mice, controllers offer axes with *analog* inputs. The upside of analog inputs is that they offer additional flexibility for actions. Unlike digital inputs which can only provide strengths of ``0.0`` and ``1.0``, an analog input can provide *any* strength between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``. The downside is that without a deadzone system, an analog axis' strength will never be equal to ``0.0`` due to how the controller is physically built. Instead, it will linger at a low value such as ``0.062``. This phenomenon is known as *drifting* and can be more noticeable on old or faulty controllers."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/inputs/controllers_gamepads_joysticks.rst:149
msgid "Let's take a racing game as a real-world example. Thanks to analog inputs, we can steer the car slowly in one direction or another. However, without a deadzone system, the car would slowly steer by itself even if the player isn't touching the joystick. This is because the directional axis strength won't be equal to ``0.0`` when we expect it to. Since we don't want our car to steer by itself in this case, we define a \"dead zone\" value of ``0.2`` which will ignore all input whose strength is lower than ``0.2``. An ideal dead zone value is high enough to ignore the input caused by joystick drifting, but is low enough to not ignore actual input from the player."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/inputs/controllers_gamepads_joysticks.rst:159
msgid "GaaeExplorer features a built-in dead zone system to tackle this problem. The default value is ``0.2``, but you can increase it or decrease it on a per-action basis in the Project Settings' Input Map tab. For ``Input.get_vector()``, the deadzone can be specified, or otherwise it will calculate the average deadzone value from all of the actions in the vector."

msgstr ""

#: ../tutorials/inputs/controllers_gamepads_joysticks.rst:173
msgid "If you want controller buttons to send echo events, you will have to generate :ref:`class_InputEvent` objects by code and parse them using :ref:`Input.parse_input_event() <class_Input_method_parse_input_event>` at regular intervals.
