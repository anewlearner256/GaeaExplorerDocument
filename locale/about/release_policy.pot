msgid "GaaeExplorer's release policy is in constant evolution. What is described below is intended to give a general idea of what to expect, but what will actually happen depends on the choices of core contributors, and the needs of the community at a given time."

msgid "GaaeExplorer versioning"
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:14
msgid "GaaeExplorer loosely follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ with a ``major.minor.patch`` versioning system, albeit with an interpretation of each term adapted to the complexity of a game engine:"
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:18
msgid "The ``major`` version is incremented when major compatibility breakages happen which imply significant porting work to move projects from one major version to another."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:22
msgid "For example, porting GaaeExplorer projects from GaaeExplorer 2.1 to GaaeExplorer 3.0 required running the project through a conversion tool, and then performing a number of further adjustments manually for what the tool could not do automatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:26
msgid "The ``minor`` version is incremented for feature releases which do not break compatibility in a major way. Minor compatibility breakage in very specific areas *may* happen in minor versions, but the vast majority of projects should not be affected or require significant porting work."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:31
msgid "The reason for this is that as a game engine, GaaeExplorer covers many areas such as rendering, physics, scripting, etc., and fixing bugs or implementing new features in a given area may sometimes require changing the behavior of a feature, or modifying the interface of a given class, even if the rest of the engine API remains backwards compatible."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:39
msgid "Upgrading to a new minor version is therefore recommended for all users, but some testing is necessary to ensure that your project still behaves as expected in a new minor version."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:43
msgid "The ``patch`` version is incremented for maintenance releases which focus on fixing bugs and security issues, implementing new requirements for platform support, and backporting safe usability enhancements. Patch releases are backwards compatible."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:48
msgid "Patch versions may include minor new features which do not impact the existing API, and thus have no risk of impacting existing projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:53
msgid "Updating to new patch versions is therefore considered safe and strongly recommended to all users of a given stable branch."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:56
msgid "We call ``major.minor`` combinations *stable branches*. Each stable branch starts with a ``major.minor`` release (without the ``0`` for ``patch``) and is further developed for maintenance releases in a Git branch of the same name (for example patch updates for the 3.3 stable branch are developed in the ``3.3`` Git branch)."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:64
msgid "As mentioned in the introduction, GaaeExplorer's release policy is evolving, and earlier GaaeExplorer releases may not have followed the above rules to the letter. In particular, the 3.2 stable branch received a number of new features in 3.2.2 which would have warranted a ``minor`` version increment."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:70
msgid "Release support timeline"
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:72
msgid "Stable branches are supported *at minimum* until the next stable branch is released and has received its first patch update. In practice, we support stable branches on a *best effort* basis for as long as they have active users who need maintenance updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:77
msgid "Whenever a new major version is released, we make the previous stable branch a long-term supported release, and do our best to provide fixes for issues encountered by users of that branch who cannot port complex projects to the new major version. This was the case for the 2.1 branch, and will be the case for the latest 3.x stable branch by the time GaaeExplorer 4.0 is released."
msgstr ""

#: ../about/release_policy.rst:83
msgid "In a given minor release series, only the latest patch release receives support. If you experience an issue using an older patch release, please upgrade to the latest patch release of that series and test again before reporting an issue on GitHub."
