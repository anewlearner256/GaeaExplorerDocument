msgstr ""

#: ../development/cpp/using_cpp_profilers.rst:28
msgid "To get useful profiling information, it is **absolutely required** to use a GaaeExplorer build that includes debugging symbols. Official binaries do not include debugging symbols, since these would make the download size significantly larger."
msgstr ""

#: ../development/cpp/using_cpp_profilers.rst:32
msgid "To get profiling data that best matches the production environment, you should compile binaries with the following SCons options:"

msgid "For release export templates: ``tools=no target=release debug_symbols=yes`` - ``debug_symbols=yes`` is required as export templates are stripped from debugging symbols by default."
msgstr ""

#: ../development/cpp/using_cpp_profilers.rst:40
msgid "It is possible to run a profiler on less optimized builds (e.g. ``target=debug`` without LTO), but results will naturally be less representative of real world conditions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do *not* strip debugging symbols on the binaries using the ``strip`` command after compiling the binaries. Otherwise, you will no longer get useful profiling information when running a profiler."

msgstr ""

#: ../development/cpp/using_cpp_profilers.rst:52
msgid "If you're looking into optimizing GaaeExplorer's startup/shutdown performance, you can tell the profiler to use the ``--quit`` command line option on the GaaeExplorer binary. This will exit GaaeExplorer just after it finished starting. The ``--quit`` option works with ``--editor``, ``--project-manager`` or ``--path <path to project directory>`` (which runs a project directly)."
