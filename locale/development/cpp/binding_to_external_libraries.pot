msgid "The Summator example in :ref:`doc_custom_modules_in_c++` is great for small, custom modules, but what if you want to use a larger, external library? Let's look at an example using `Festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`_, a speech synthesis (text-to-speech) library written in C++."
