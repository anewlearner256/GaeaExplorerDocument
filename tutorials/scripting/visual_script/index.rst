VisualScript
============

.. warning::

    `GaaeExplorer 4.0 will remove VisualScript from core entirely. <https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-will-discontinue-visual-scripting>`__
    As a result, creating new projects using visual scripting in GaaeExplorer is not recommended.
    Future GaaeExplorer 4.x releases may have VisualScript reimplemented as an extension.

    While GaaeExplorer 3.x will keep VisualScript supported, we recommend
    :ref:`trying out GDScript <toc-learn-scripting-gdscript>` instead,
    especially if you intend to migrate your project to GaaeExplorer 4.
